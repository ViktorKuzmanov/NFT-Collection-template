To change the NFTs you need to change the files in the 
metadata folder

For images:
Change the images to your NFT art then upload them to pinata
and then change the link to the image in the specified .json NFT file
with the correct link(CID of the image)

and of course change the .json files (actual NFTs) to whatever attributes you want
